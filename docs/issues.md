This page serves as a collection of common issues when setting up Understrap. Please use the link at the bottom to suggest any additional items.

**The language flags of the menu items of the Polylang plugin are not visible.**

If you're not seeing the language flags for Polylang, this has been discussed here [Issue #1305](https://github.com/understrap/understrap/issues/1305)

**npm ERR! Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X 64-bit with Unsupported runtime (93)**

We recommend running `node -v` to check on what version of Node you're running. Node-sass seems requires node be v14 or below.

**Whenever I add a submenu, my parent menu item link shows a hashtag instead of the URL.**

This is a default behavior of Understrap. Because the dropdown menu needs a 'click' to trigger it, the theme removes the link from the parent item. If it were a link, it would open the link instead of showing dropdown when you click it.
â€‹
If you do want to override that behavior, it requires using code to override the nav menu walker that generates the menu.

You'll want to make a copy of main class in the `/inc/class-wp-bootstrap-navwalker.php` file in your child theme. Then you'll want to comment out or remove [line 193](https://github.com/understrap/understrap/blob/main/inc/class-wp-bootstrap-navwalker.php#L193) which overwrites the `$atts['href']` value with the `#` symbol. 

We'd also recommend adding some styles that will show the dropdown menu automatically when a user hovers over it, like so:

```css
.nav-item.dropdown:hover .dropdown-menu {
	display: block;
}
```
