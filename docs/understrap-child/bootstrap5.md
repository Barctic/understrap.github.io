# Bootstrap 5 Updates

As of release 1.1.0, the child theme defaults to using Bootstrap 5 and requires Understrap Parent Theme 1.1 or greater for best functionality. It does not create JS or CSS files that work with Bootstrap 4 markup. In fact, in the functions.php file, this child theme overrides the parent theme's customizer settings.

If you want to build a child theme with Bootstrap 4, please use <a href="https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child/releases/tag/v1.0.1">the 1.0.1 child theme release</a> as it was the last version built to support Bootstrap 4.
