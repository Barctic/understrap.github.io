# Introduction

Welcome to Understrap. Understrap is a WordPress theme framework. It's based on Bootstrap 5 and the starter theme Underscores, from Automattic. All glued together by npm and Sass.

You can use it as a starter theme itself and build your own design theme on top of it. Or you can use it as a parent theme framework and create your own child theme for Understrap. We recommend the second route in this documentation.

These docs are broken into a few sections:

## Theme Setup

For users who are just using the parent theme, or are updating things like menus and widgets from inside WordPress, [this section](understrap-parent/) offers full explanation of the theme's default capabilities.

## Child Theme Development

If you're planning on developing a custom theme, we recommend visiting the [Child Starter Theme Documentation](understrap-child/).

## Understrap Academy
