# Introduction

Welcome to Understrap. UnderStrap is a WordPress theme framework. It based on Bootstrap 4 and the starter theme Underscores. All glued together by npm, Gulp and Sass.

You can use it as starter theme itself and build your own design theme on top of it. Or you use it as parent theme framework and create your own child theme for UnderStrap. We recommend the second route in this documentation.

These docs are broken into a few sections:

## Theme Setup

For users who are just using the parent theme, or are updating things like menus and widgets from inside WordPress, this section offers full explanation of the theme's default capabilities.

## Child Theme Development

If you're planning on developing a custom theme, we recommend using the [Child Starter Theme](https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child). These docs will take you through setup for your local development, as well as some of the common customizations you might need to make.
