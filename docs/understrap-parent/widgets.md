# Widgets and Sidebars

The theme comes with five main widget areas: Two sidebar widgets, one full size "hero" widget and two dynamic widgets area above and below the main content.

## Hero Canvas 
A full size widget area right below the top navigation. Its a blank canvas for your Bootstrap markup, for example for a Jumbotron

## Top Full
A dynamic widget area above the main content and below the Hero Canvas or top navbar. "Dynamic" means: If you publish one widget here it will take 100% of its size. If you publish two widgets both use 50% width and will be rendered side-by-side. With three widgets you have three column and so on...

## Left and Right Sidebar
Widget ares on the left and right of main content. Keep in mind: This widget ares will be shown ONLY if a widget is published there AND if the sidebar is part of your Theme Layout set under `Appereance -> Customizer -> Theme Layout Settings`. By default this is set to "Right Sidebar". That means the left sidebar is not rendered even if you publish a widget there.

## FooterFull
A dynamic sidebar like "Top Full", but below the main content.
