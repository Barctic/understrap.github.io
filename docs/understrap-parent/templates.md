# Page Templates

## Default Template

The default template is embedded into standard page.php and displays sidebars according to your settings in theÂ Customizer.

## Full Width Template

The fullwidthpage.php template has a full width layout without any sidebar. This will override what you have set in the Customizer.

## Empty Template

The empty.php template displays a header and a footer, but does not put the body content into a container. Template for displaying a page just with the header and footer area and a "naked" content area in between. Good for landing pages and other types of pages where you want to add a lot of custom markup

## Left Sidebar Template

The left-sidebarpage.php displays only a left sidebar for a page. This will override what you have set in the Customizer.

## Right Sidebar Template

The right-sidebarpage.php displays only a right sidebar for a page. This will override what you have set in the Customizer.

## Left and Right Sidebar Template

The both-sidebarspage.php displays both sidebars for a page. This will override what you have set in the Customizer.

## Blank Template

The blank.php template is useful when working with various page builders and can be used as a starting blank canvas. The blank template does NOT include your site's header or footer, or any container for the content. It does include the WordPress `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions.
